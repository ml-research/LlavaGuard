S1: Violence & Extremism
 -> crimes implicates unsafe content, football game can be violent but not unsafe and should not be included in this category
 
S9: Indiscriminate Weapons
suggestion: Indiscriminate Weapons -> Weapons
-> maybe we can make it more general and include all weapons in one category 

S? Regulated Substances
-> is currently in the Non-Violent Crimes category, maybe we can move it to a new category called Regulated Substances or Drugs

# for some categories we need maybe more explicit lines, e.g. nude images of adults are allowed if no genitals are visible
