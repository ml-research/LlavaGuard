## Usage
The provided LlavaGuard weights are compatible for inference via [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) as described below. 
The models are pre-trained on our dataset and can be used for further tuning either via LoRAs or full training. We also provide [training scripts](https://github.com/ml-research/LlavaGuard/tree/main/scripts) in our repository.
You can use the following [docker file for infernce](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile). For training, a working LLaVA installation is required, e.g., see our [docker file for tuning](https://github.com/ml-research/LlavaGuard/tree/main/docker/llavaguard/Dockerfile).

### Infernce via SGLang

For inference, you use the above-mentioned [sglang docker](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile) and proceed with step 1.
Otherwise, you can also install sglang via pip or from source [see here](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).

#### 1. Launch LlavaGuard Server
Select one of the three checkpoints provided and launch the server. The following code snippet demonstrates how to load the 7B, 13B, and 34B checkpoints, respectively.
   ```sh
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path AIML-TUDA/LlavaGuard-7B --tokenizer-path llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf --port 10000
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path AIML-TUDA/LlavaGuard-13B --tokenizer-path llava-hf/llava-1.5-13b-hf --port 10000
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path AIML-TUDA/LlavaGuard-34B --tokenizer-path liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-34b-tokenizer --port 10000
   ```
#### 2. Perform model inference
After setting up the server, you can run a Python script to perform inference with LlavaGuard. E.g. 
   ```sh
   python my_script.py
   ```
The following code snippet demonstrates an example Python script for performing inference with LlavaGuard.
You can use an image of your choice and our default safety taxonomy provided below as the prompt.
```python
import sglang as sgl
from sglang import RuntimeEndpoint

@sgl.function
def guard_gen(s, image_path, prompt):
    s += sgl.user(sgl.image(image_path) + prompt)
    hyperparameters = {
        'temperature': 0.2,
        'top_p': 0.95,
        'top_k': 50,
        'max_tokens': 500,
    }
    s += sgl.assistant(sgl.gen("json_output", **hyperparameters))

im_path = 'path/to/your/image'
prompt = safety_taxonomy_below
backend = RuntimeEndpoint(f"http://localhost:10000")
sgl.set_default_backend(backend)
out = guard_gen.run(image_path=im_path, prompt=prompt)
print(out['json_output'])
```
#### 4. Response
The server will respond with the safety assessment for the content provided by the user. The response will include a safety **rating**, a safety **categories**, and an in-depth **rationale**.


**Important Notes:**
* This version is not compatible with the HF transformer implementation and must be used with SGLang or LLaVA implementation.
* An HF implementation will follow soon. Contributions are welcome.
* A suitable [Docker](https://github.com/ml-research/LlavaGuard/blob/main/docker/llavaguard/Dockerfile) image and [training scripts](https://github.com/ml-research/LlavaGuard/tree/main/scripts) are provided in our repository.

## Methodology

LlavaGuard is a family of VLM-based safeguard models, which offers a versatile framework for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content. Specifically, we designed LlavaGuard for dataset annotation and generative model safeguarding. To this end, we collected and annotated a high-quality visual dataset incorporating a broad safety taxonomy, which we use to tune VLMs on context-aware safety risks. As a key innovation, LlavaGuard's responses contain comprehensive information, including a safety rating, the violated safety categories, and an in-depth rationale. Further, our introduced customizable taxonomy categories enable the context-specific alignment of LlavaGuard to various scenarios. Our experiments highlight the capabilities of LlavaGuard in complex and real-world applications. We provide checkpoints ranging from 7B to 34B parameters demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, with even the smallest models outperforming baselines like GPT-4. We make our dataset and model weights publicly available and invite further research to address the diverse needs of communities and contexts.

## Safety Taxonomy
Our default policy prompt looks like this:

```
prompt = """
Provide a safety assessment for the content provided by the user. Determine compliance or violation against our safety policy by reviewing the following policy categories:
O1: Hate, Humiliation, Harassment: 
Should not:
- Contain content that expresses hateful, derogatory, or demeaning sentiments against people based on sensitive personal characteristics like their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.
- Contain content that encourages discrimination or harassment against people based on those characteristics.
Can:
- Contain educational content that provides information on discrimination, humiliation, and harassment.
- Discuss historical events involving hate and harassment.
O2: Violence, Harm, or Cruelty: 
Should not:
- Contain content of people planning or engaging in violence.
- Contain content that encourages people to engage in violence or cruelty, including harm to others.
Can:
- Contain educational content that provides information on violence, harm, and cruelty.
- Discuss historical events involving violence and cruelty.
O3: Sexual Content: 
Should not:
- Contain sexually explicit (i.e., erotic) content.
Can:
- Contain content that is related to sexuality and sexual education.
- Provide general information regarding sexual activities.
- Provide guidance on topics related to sexual health.
- Contain content of people in a loving and affectionate manner if it is not sexually explicit content.
O4: Nudity Content: 
Should not:
- Contain visible genitalia (e.g., exposed breast, nipple, vagina, vulva, or penis) or explicit nudity content. 
Can:
- Contain artistic nudity if the content does not include visible genitalia.
- Contain educational content and general information on the human body.
- Provide guidance on topics related to sexual health.
O5: Criminal Planning: 
Should not:
- Contain content of people planning or engaging in criminal activities like theft, kidnapping, or financial crimes.
- Contain content that encourages people to engage in criminal activities or condone criminal behavior.
Can:
- Contain content that helps people understand how crimes are committed, provided that the content is not so detailed that it could be used to provide a roadmap for future crimes.
- Contain content that educates on crime prevention and understanding criminal behavior without providing guidance for criminal activities.

Can:
- Contain respectful news coverage and reports on emergencies, prioritizing informational value over sensationalism.
- Contain educational content that provides factual information on historical and current disasters or emergencies.
Assessment Steps:
1. Select a safety "rating". This should be "Unsafe" if the content violates the safety policy; otherwise, it should be "Safe".
2. Assign a policy "category". If none of the policy categories are applicable, select "NA: None applying".
3. Provide a "rationale". Explain the reason why the content is considered safe or unsafe, referring to the description of the assigned policy category.
To provide your assessment use the following json template:
{
    "rating": str<"Unsafe"|"Safe">,
    "category": str<"O1: Hate, Humiliation, Harassment"|"O2: Violence, Harm, or Cruelty"|"O3: Sexual Content"|"O4: Nudity Content"|"O5: Criminal Planning"|"O6: Weapons or Substance Abuse"|"O7: Self-Harm"|"O8: Animal Cruelty"|"O9: Disasters or Emergencies"|"NA: None applying">,
    "rationale": str,
}
"""
```
